# Creational Patterns - Builder Pattern

## Overview

The Builder Pattern is another important design pattern within the creational patterns group, which focuses on object-creation mechanisms. The primary purpose of the Builder Pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Why Use Builder Pattern?

1. **Complex Object Creation:** Facilitates the creation of complex objects with numerous attributes.
2. **Readable and Maintainable Code:** Enhances code readability and maintainability by separating object construction from its representation.
3. **Step-by-Step Construction:** Provides a clear process for constructing objects step by step.

## Benefits of Builder Pattern

1. **Flexible Design:** Allows different representations of an object to be created using the same construction process.
2. **Isolation of Construction and Representation:** Separates the logic for constructing an object from its representation, improving code organization.
3. **Step-by-Step Object Construction:** Enables objects to be constructed in a controlled and predictable manner.

## Drawbacks of Builder Pattern

1. **Increased Complexity:** Can introduce additional complexity with multiple builder classes and methods.
2. **Overhead of Builder Class:** The necessity of creating builder classes and methods may result in some overhead.
3. **Potential for Misuse:** Without proper understanding, the pattern can be misused, leading to convoluted code.
